# BIML_to_GBIF

[The USGS Native Bee Inventory and Monitoring Lab (BIML)](https://www.usgs.gov/labs/native-bee-inventory-and-monitoring-lab/usgs-native-bee-inventory-and-monitoring-lab#:~:text=USGS%20Native%20Bee%20Inventory%20and%20Monitoring%20Lab%20%28BIML%29,federal%2C%20state%2C%20academic%2C%20non-profit%2C%20citizen%20and%20international%20groups.) has a large collection of bee specimens and occurrences. Traditionally it has been published to GBIF as one large dataset ([https://doi.org/10.15468/6autvb](https://doi.org/10.15468/6autvb).

This project will break out a subset of the data as a separate GBIF dataset, while maintaining the `occurrenceIDs` that were used in the past.  The goal is to increase the flexibility of tracking credit and reuse for USFWS GLRI.

This project is on hold while we regroup after Paulina being let go.
